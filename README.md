# SPRING BOOT REST WEBCLIENT
This repository explores Spring Boot REST Webclient.

> If you want to compare Java alternatives for the SB REST Webclient, have a look at our [Java REST Client Examples repository](https://github.com/gabrielcostasilva/java-rest-client.git).

## Overview of Projects
Each folder groups a single REST client as follows:

- [_RestClient Web_](./restclient-web/) features the newest Spring Rest Client for Web apps (> SB 3.2).

- [_RestClient Web - Interface_](./restclient-web-interface/) based on the [_RestClient Web_](./restclient-web/), this project explores a simpler way of building REST clients by using interfaces.

- [_RestClient Web - Interface HEADERS_](./restclient-web-interface-headers) extends the [_RestClient Web - Interface_](./restclient-web-interface/) to show how to access request header data.

- [_RestClient Test_](./rest-client-test/) tests a REST Client using a MockServer and @RestClientTest.
